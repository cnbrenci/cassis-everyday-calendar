![edc](/images/edc.gif)

## Overview

This repository contains firmware and schematics of the [Every Day Calendar](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/simonegiertz/the-every-day-calendar) project.

Please note that this is a finished project. The files are provided as is and we will not be maintaining this repository.


## Installation

To download the firmware and schematic files, run the following command on your terminal:


    git clone https://gitlab.com/simonegiertz/the-every-day-calendar.git
## Firmware

### Connecting the Every Day Calendar to the Arduino IDE

1. Power on the Every Day Calendar with a 5V adapter and connect the calendar to your computer using a USB Type-B to USB Typ-A cable.

2. Open the Arduino IDE

   - Configure the board type to **Arduino Pro or Pro Mini**

### Installing Arduino Libraries

1. Copy the contents of this repository's *firmware > libraries* directory into your computer's Arduino libraries folder.
   
   - Typically that's located in **Documents/Arduino/libraries**
   
   **Note:** If more instruction is needed, follow Arduino's guide: https://www.arduino.cc/en/guide/libraries

To test and see if the custom libraries are working, you can run our sample code provided in the *firmware > sketches* directory of this Github repository. Simply upload one of the sample code files onto the calendar using the Arduino IDE, open the **Serial Monitor** and set the baud rate to **9600**.
